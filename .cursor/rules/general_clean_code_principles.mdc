- Keep functions small and focused
- One class per file
- Limit function size to 20 lines if possible
- Avoid long parameter lists (max 3–4 parameters)
- Minimize nested control structures
- Remove commented-out code before committing
- Prefer meaningful names over comments
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): extract duplication
