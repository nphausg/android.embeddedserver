globs:

- Annotate Application class with @HiltAndroidApp
- Use @HiltViewModel for ViewModel injection
- Provide dependencies in @Module with @InstallIn
- Inject interfaces rather than concrete implementations
- Use qualifiers when multiple implementations exist
- Avoid static singletons outside of Hiltâ€™s graph
- Keep modules small and logically grouped
