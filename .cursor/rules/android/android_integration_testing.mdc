- Integration tests should verify interactions between multiple layers (e.g., ViewModel + Repository + Data Source).
- Use **Hilt Test Components** or DI overrides to inject fake or in-memory dependencies.
- Avoid hitting real external services; use mocked network responses or test databases.
- Write integration tests to cover critical user flows end-to-end.
- Keep tests stable and repeatable; clean up any test data after execution.
- Use **JUnit Rules** or **TestContainers** where applicable for environment setup/teardown.
- Separate integration tests from unit tests and run them less frequently (e.g., nightly builds).
