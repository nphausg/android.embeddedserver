- Follow domain/data/presentation separation: domain is business logic, data is data sources, presentation is UI.
- Keep domain layer free of Android framework dependencies.
- Use UseCases (Interactors) for business rules, triggered from ViewModels or Controllers.
- Repositories should expose interfaces, not implementations.
- Avoid directly accessing data sources in presentation layer.
- Prefer dependency inversion: inject interfaces rather than concrete classes.
- Maintain simple, testable domain models.
