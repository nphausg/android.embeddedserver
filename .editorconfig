# --- One-Line Preference Configuration! ‚≠ê ---
# This is where we tell KtLint to be less aggressive with line breaks and
# keep things on one line as much as possible, respecting 'max_line_length'.

# 1. Disable multiline-expression-wrapping:
# This is key for short lambdas, if-expressions, when-branches to stay on one line.
# Example: `val result = if (condition) "A" else "B"` instead of breaking.
# Disabling this means it will only break if 'max_line_length' is exceeded.
ktlint_standard_multiline-expression-wrapping = disabled

# 2. Disable string-template-indent (often related to multiline-expression-wrapping issues)
ktlint_standard_string-template-indent = disabled

# 3. Consider disabling argument-list-wrapping if it's too eager to break:
# Default behavior for KtLint might put each argument on a new line if it exceeds a certain length.
# Disabling it means arguments will try to stay on one line until 'max_line_length' is hit.
# ktlint_standard_argument-list-wrapping = disabled # Uncomment to try this!

# 4. Consider disabling chain-wrapping for chained calls:
# If you prefer `obj.doSomething().anotherThing()` to stay on one line until it's too long.
# ktlint_standard_chain-wrapping = disabled # Uncomment to try this!
